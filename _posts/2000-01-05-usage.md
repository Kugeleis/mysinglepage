## Usage

Alright, you've got a clean copy and are ready to push some schmancy pages for the world to ogle at.

- Edit `_config.yml` to change your title, keywords, and description.
- Create a new file in `_posts/` called `2014-01-01-intro.md`
  Edit it, and add:

~~~
  ---
  title: "home"
  bg: white
  color: black
  style: center
  ---

  # Example headline!
  and so on..
~~~

- Create a second post called `2014-01-02-art.md` with an divider image this time:

~~~
  ---
  title: "Art"
  bg: blue
  color: white
  fa-icon: paint-brush
  ---

  #### A new section- oh the humanity!
~~~

**Note:** That part `fa-icon: paint-brush` will use a font-awesome icon of [paint-brush](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/paint-brush/). You can use any icon from this [font-awesome icon directory](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

- run `jekyll serve -w` and visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see a live locally served preview.
  (if that doesn't work you probably need to install Jekyll with `sudo gem install github-pages`)
- Push changes and see them live!



## Changing your color theme

The `_config.yml` file has this part:

{% highlight yaml linenos=table %}
colors:
  black:
    light: '#303030'
    dark: '#111111'
  white:
  .. etc
{% endhighlight %}

Edit these (and manually restart your local server with ^C and `jekyll serve -w` to see changes)
