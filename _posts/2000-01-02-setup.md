#### Basically

# this theme rocks.

#### let's get started setting it up!

#### Also check out the [github project docs!](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)

There are about *a billion* ways to get started.

We're going to use my **fork, rename, branch, and modify** method. It will get you started quickly and let you update easily.

There are three way to get started based on what you want to do:

1. [As a user (or organization) root page](#setup-as-user-root-page). It will live at `<username>.github.io` (or your own custom domain if you want)
2. [As a standalone project page](#setup-as-a-standalone-project-page). It will live at `<username>.github.io/<ProjectName>`.
3. [As a branch inside an existing project](#setup-inside-existing-project) that'll give you a fancy page at `<username>.github.io/<ProjectName>`.
