## Setup inside existing project

This is the most complicated use-case .. but it's the coolest.
Say you've got your kickass project `github.com/t413/kicker` and want to have
some web presence to post about on [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com).
This will create an orphan branch called `gh_pages` in your repository
where you can publish changes, posts, images, and such. It won't alter your code at all.

- `cd` into your project on the command line
- use `git remote add singlepage git@github.com:t413/SinglePaged.git` to get access to this repository.
- use `git pull singlepage` to pull the remote branch
- use `git branch --set-upstream gh-pages singlepage/gh-pages; git checkout gh-pages;`
  This creates and checks out an orphan branch called gh-pages that tracks the original and lets you make changes.
- **Important** Run `git rm _posts/*; commit -m "Removing example posts";`
  This will prevent any future updates to those articles creating conflicts when they're updated.
- Edit your _config.yml file
  * change the title, keywords, and description
  * edit, remove, or add colors. (These are referenced by name later in each section post.)
- Create some _posts/ md files, these show up as sections
- When you run `git push gh-pages:origin/gh-pages` it'll be live at *username.github.io/repositoryName*
