Having an embedded video is often inflexible with a dynamic and responsive design.

If you embed your video like I've embedded this one:

```
<div class="icontain"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8yis7GzlXNM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
```

It'll play like that one! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.
